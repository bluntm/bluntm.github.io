<h1>HEALTHY LIVING WITH DIABETES</h1>
<h3><em>Here at DiaBetty’s Delight Ice Cream Shoppe, we take the time to indulge. 
    But we spend a lot of time curating our diet to best control our disease. 
    It is important to eat a well-balanced diet with protein, dairy, fruits and vegetables. 
    But which ones are best? Why is one better than the other? And where can I find more information to support a healthy diet?<br> 
 </em></h3>
 <div class="left"><h2>Vegetables</h2>
        <p class="text">Non-starchy vegetables are your best friend! Everyone can enjoy more of these as they are chock full of vitamins, 
        minerals, and fiber. They contain less carbohydrates and calories. Fresh is always preferred but frozen is also an 
        excellent option. If you must go for canned look for a lower sodium version and always rinse before cooking.
        We should be looking to eat at least 3 servings of veggies per day. A serving is one cup raw, .5 cup cooked. 
        When cooking your veggies, steaming is best; followed by sautéing then boiling.
    </p></div>

<div class="right"><h2>Fruits</h2>
<p class="text">Fruits, like vegetables are an important part of a diabetic diet and knowing which ones might 
    be than others can give you power. Most fruits have a low glycemic index because of their fructose 
    and fiber content. Fruits contain carbohydrates and that is important to know and count as part of your diet plan.
     Like veggies the preferred medium is fresh, frozen, then canned without added sugars. Choose canned fruits in juice 
     or light syrup. Don’t forget to count 100% fruit juice as a serving and that dried fruit
     is counted a little differently but still both good options.
</p></div>
<div class="left"><h2>Dairy</h2><p class="text">
        Including sources of dairy in your meal plan is a great way to get calcium and high-quality protein.
         And with admitted bias we enjoy ice cream as our preferred food medium of diary.
</p></div>
<div class="right"><h2>Protein</h2><p class="text">
        Foods high in protein such as fish, chicken, meats, soy products, and cheese, 
        are all called “protein foods.” The biggest difference among foods in this group is how much fat they contain, 
        and for the vegetarian proteins, whether they have carbohydrate. You may also hear them referred to as ‘meats or meat substitutes.” 
        Plant-based protein foods provide quality protein, healthy fats, and fiber. They vary in how much fat and carbohydrate they contain, 
        so make sure to read labels. Try to include fish at least 2 times per week. Choose poultry without the skin for less saturated fat and 
        cholesterol. It’s best to limit your intake of red meat which is often higher in saturated fat and processed meats like ham, bacon 
        and hot dogs which are often higher in saturated fat and sodium. If you decide to have these, choose the leanest options.
