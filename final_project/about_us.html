        <h2>Usability/About Page</h2>
            <p class="text">Hi!  I am an artists, crafter, painter, and much more.  I have experience with Computer Graphics, layouts, logos, etc.  
                I also program but not that experience as I want to be.  I am organized and can multi-task.  Professional and office experience 
                for many many years. I am familiar with Adobe Creative Suites as well as Microsoft products.</p>

        <h2>Jessica Bouvier</h2>
        <h2>Contact/About Us Pages</h2>
        <p class="text">This is my first web design course. I feel like I am catching on very quickly with this! 
            It is not as hard as I thought it would be. I am great with multitasking and time management.
             I am about 1 yr away from obtaining my Marketing degree from LCC. I thought a web design class would be beneficial. 
             So far it is proving to me, that it was a great decision.  I also run a cake business, so my attention to detail is top notch. 
            I also like to complete complicated assignments ahead of time. That way there is time to make adjustments if need be.</p>

        <h2>Mary Grace Blunt</h2>
        <h2>Project Manager/Coder/Wireframes/Home Page</h2>
        <p class="text">My strong point is design. I took an interface design class last semester which I enjoyed considerably.
             I have done a lot of coding as well, but front end is more up my alley.

        <h2>Ron Durga</h2>
        <h2>Co-Project Manager/Catering/Template Pages</h2>
        <p class="text">When it comes to the team project I am very confident in my ability to fulfill any role that is asked of me.
             I have experience in coding using C++, php, MySQL, Python, and others. I am also very organized in my professional
              and everyday life. I have being maintaining a website that uses WordPress as it's foundation for the last 3 years. 
              This has given me a lot of insight into how web pages should flow, and how to properly display content. Microsoft paint, 
              is my preferred content creator, but I do have some experience using Adobe Photoshop.</p>

        <h2>Melissa Battaglia</h2>
        <h2>Content Researcher/Diabetes Page</h2>
        <p class="text">Being a Mom I have serious multitasking skills. I have had some programming classes (python, c#) and enjoy html. 
            I also have worked on some design aspects of a website and have an artful eye. I can usually Google my way through any issue car, internet, computer, health, 
            or life related. I am a self starter and punctual. My crazy schedule does sometimes cause me to have dedicated times I can or cannot work.
             I've been a 4.0 student since middle school and I'm 38 now. </p>

        <h2>Niraad Patel</h2>
        <h2>Graphic Designer/Flavors Page</h2>
        <p class="text">Designing is my forte. I'm a 3D Artist / Graphic Designer. I have ample experience of a professional setting. 
            I love to design using Adobe Creative Suite, 3D programs, such as Autodesk Maya and Pixologic ZBrush. 3D models, motion graphics, 
            UI/UX design, web-pages, image manipulation, you name it and chances are I've done it. I'm also comfortable writing HTML/CSS codes.
             I do not wish to undertake responsibilities as a project manager,
             because my full time job, 19 months old daughter, and family demands around the clock attention. </p>
