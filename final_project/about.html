    <em><h3>DiaBetty’s Delight Ice Cream Shoppe was established in 1905 by Hirum Hoffbauer, an immigrant from Belgium. 
        When Mr. Hoffbauer arrived in the United States, he only had a few dollars in his pocket but had a dream of owning his own business.
         With diabetes and limited with what he could eat as dessert, he thought of his favorite dessert: ice cream. 
         He then came up with this idea as a business for those who have diabetes and those who simply just love ice cream.
          The store business started slowly, but with patience and educating the public and customers,
           he was able to draw in customers who continuously returned for his ice creams. With word of mouth and news spreading of
            his wonderful flavors that are not only are healthy for diabetics but also the wondrous taste, his business started to boom. 
            Thirty years later, he owned ten stores in four cities.
         The third generation of Hoffbauers is proud of their roots and continue to operate this family-run company to this day.<br>
